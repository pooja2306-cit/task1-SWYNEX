# QuickDesk

A lightweight helpdesk web application where customers raise support tickets and support agents track, assign, and resolve them in one place.

> **Status:** Starter repository. This repo contains the architecture document and a basic project scaffold. Features are not fully implemented yet.

## Problem

Small teams often handle support through scattered emails and chats, so requests get lost, ownership is unclear, and there is no visibility into ticket status. QuickDesk gives them a single, simple place to manage support requests.

## Users and Roles

- **Customer:** creates tickets, views their status, and replies to agents
- **Agent:** views the ticket queue, assigns tickets, updates status, and replies
- **Admin (optional):** manages agents

## Core Features

- Register and log in
- Create a support ticket (title, description, priority)
- View my tickets and their status
- Agent queue with filters (status, priority)
- Assign tickets and update status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
- Comment thread on each ticket

**Out of scope (for now):** email integration, file attachments, SLA timers, live chat, analytics.

## Tech Stack

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- PostgreSQL (if running the backend with a database)

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in your values

### Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Environment Variables
